                    I must have written & compiled dozens of wine list over the years (this is a great task to volunteer for.... research... research ... research my old F&B  managers said was the secret of a great wine list..... maybe not a great liver though)
I could fill a page with my favourite second, third, forth & fifth growth wines (never had a first label 1st Growth Bordeaux)
or even swamp it with my favourite aromatic floral beauties from Alsace
... Rich Magret River Chardonnays, English bubbly, thick pinot noir masterpieces from Burgundy, Super Tuscans oh .. the list is endless..
But wine snobs are the biggest bores.... My taste isn't all top end (not just because my budget isnt top end)... Although my dislike for the power, bulling, homogenization of the wine on the shelves of supermarkets is strong .. here it comes...I buy there for myself sometimes... Asda does the greatest Gr√ºner Veltliner at a price that my wine supplier can't purchase it. Tesco and the rest have a few hidden gems worth seeking out. Yes i know the super markets are the place that 90% of us buy our wine ... but I still like the idea of buying meat from a butcher, fish from a fishmonger and yes wine from a passionate supplier...
So back to the task at hand.... Write a wine list for a pub & its customers 
(and Carol and myself of course). Our food is honest, good value and with a wide appealing range of flavour.. and so you will see is the wine list.
