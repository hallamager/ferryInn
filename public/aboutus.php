                    The Ferry Inn, Stokesby is a newly refurbished riverside pub.  Under new management since February 2009, the pub has been transformed. We hope you will like the bright and welcoming decor.  Outside there are 30 picnic tables for those long hot summer days and nights and for the children there is a small activity area.  During busy times there is a separate dining room, which is also available for private parties of approximately 40 people.
